13Clowns Add-on has been updated to 1.3.0, clean install recommended.
Changes include:
•	Lambda Scrapers are removed/discontinued. Let him RIP
•	Civitas Scrapers added - COMMUNITY BASED
•	Navigation changes, hide almost anything, customize it.
•	fixed episode displaying
•	monthly / favorites movies changed so that monthly addon updates not needed, done remotely.
•	added cartoon collections
•	HIGHLY recommended to use your own APIs, TVdB, TMdb, OMdB, etc. 
If you are using 13Clowns w/Lambda currently open SETTINGS: Providers and switch to Civitas, clear Providers and your setup. 

So why the change from Lambda to Civitas??
Lambda did so much for the community and the name is getting tarnished. It’s the right thing to do, rest in peace. 

Welcome to Civitas Scrapers. Community based module and for all to use, we encourage you to support and submit pull requests as scrapers die/break become new. The more contributors the better the quality, the better the community!
If your using Lambda now the UI is the same, you can disable what you want when you want. Good for lagging/broken scrapers. 

If you’re not using Lambda and are going to be using Civitas, its setup out of the box. If you want to change providers, go to program addons, click and hold Civitas and go to setting. You can change what you like. 
Categories include:
•	Default (free providers)
•	Foreign providers
•	Real-Debrid Providers
•	Torrents (only 2 that you need a pin from premiumize.me)
