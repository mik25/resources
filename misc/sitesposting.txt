13Clowns is a fork of Exodus/Incursion/Placenta addons, with Civitas Scrapers. If you do not like the look of the Clown there are 2 other options for you once installed. Exodus and Zanni. This can be done by going to Tools: SETTINGS: General->Appearance. Change to what you want. 
Categories include: Movies, TV Shows, 13Clowns Favorites, Monthly Actor Spotlight, Documentaries, Cartoons, YouTube playlists. Sync your Trakt, IMdB, Real-Debrid, Premiumize. 
Default setting are set to auto play, you can change SETTING: Playback
The default scraping provider is Civitas, although there is also Global providers that you can choose from in the SETTINGS: Provider menu. Just be sure to Clear PROVIDER CACHE after. 
HIGHLY recommended to use your own APIs, TVdB, TMdb, OMdB, etc.
